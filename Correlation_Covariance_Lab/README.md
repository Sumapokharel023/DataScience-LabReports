## Lab Tasks and Implementations

### 1. Hours Studied vs Marks (Covariance & Scatter Plot)
- Create a dataset of hours studied and marks scored for 10 students
- Calculate the covariance between hours studied and marks
- Visualize the data using a scatter plot

**File:** [q1.py](q1.py)

---

### 2. Correlation Analysis with Regression Plot
- Using the same dataset (hours studied vs marks)
- Compute the correlation coefficient
- Interpret whether the relationship is positive, negative, or weak
- Visualize the relationship using a Seaborn regression plot

**File:** [q2.py](q2.py)

### 3. Temperature vs Ice-Cream Sales (Covariance)
- Generate a dataset of daily temperature and ice-cream sales
- Calculate the covariance between temperature and sales
- Plot the relationship using a scatter plot

**File:** [q3.py](q3.py)

---

### 4. Correlation Comparison and Interpretation
- Calculate the correlation coefficient for temperature vs ice-cream sales
- Compare covariance and correlation values
- Explain why correlation is easier to interpret than covariance

**File:** [q4.py](q4.py)

---

### 5. Random Datasets with No Relationship
- Create two random numerical datasets
- Compute covariance and correlation
- Visualize the datasets using a scatter plot
- Observe and explain the absence of a clear relationship

**File:** [q5.py](q5.py)

---

### 6. Height and Weight Statistical Analysis
- Load a dataset containing height and weight values
- Calculate:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Covariance
  - Correlation
- Visualize the data using a Seaborn jointplot

**File:** [q6.py](q6.py)

---

### 7. Linear Growth vs Random Growth Comparison
- Create one dataset with linear increase
- Create another dataset with random increase
- Compute covariance and correlation for both datasets
- Plot both cases and compare the results
