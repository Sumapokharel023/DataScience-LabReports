# Lab 3: File Handling and Exception Handling in Python

This lab focuses on **file handling techniques** in Python along with proper **exception handling** using try-except blocks. The exercises help in safely reading from and writing to files, handling incorrect inputs, and managing file-related errors.

Each question is implemented as a separate Python program.

## Questions and Code Links

### Question 1: Basic File Read and Write
File: [q1.py](q1.py)

The program:
- Creates a text file and writes multiple lines into it  
- Reads the contents of the file and displays them on the screen  
- Handles the case where the file does not exist using try-except

### Question 2: File Processing with Exception Handling
File: [q2.py](q2.py)

The program:
- Reads numbers from a text file (one number per line)  
- Ignores invalid entries using exception handling  
- Calculates and displays the sum and average of valid numbers

### Question 3: CSV File Handling
File: [q3.py](q3.py)

The program:
- Reads data from a CSV file containing student records (roll number, name, marks)  
- Displays all student records  
- Handles file-related and data conversion errors using try-except  

---

### Question 4: Writing and Reading JSON Data
File: [q4.py](q4.py)

The program:
- Stores student details (ID, name, and marks) in a JSON file  
- Reads the JSON file and displays the stored student information  
- Handles exceptions related to file access and JSON decoding

### Question 5: Menu-Driven File Operations
File: [q5.py](q5.py)

The program provides a menu-driven interface to:
- Write data to a file  
- Read data from a file  
- Append data to a file  
- Handle invalid user input and file-related errors using exception handling
